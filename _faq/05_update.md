Iridium Browser does not download and install updates automatically. Updates can only be applied manually by downloading and installing the latest build. This will not affect saved bookmarks.   
Use ````chrome://help```` to check your build version. Latest versions can always be found in the [download section](/downloads/ "download Iridium Browser / check for updates").   
It is recommended to sign up to the mailing list in order to get all information about the latest releases.
