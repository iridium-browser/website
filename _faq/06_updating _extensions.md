Updating the extensions automatically does not work as it would require a connection to the Chrome Web Store. 
This is also the reason why the extensions panel at ```chrome://extensions``` does not fully work - dis/enabling (check box) and removing (trash can) will not work.
Also, all extension will show a "Not from Chrome Web Store" note, even if downloaded from there.   
Update any extensions manually by downloading and installing the latest version. Click on the extension icon next to the address bar to access options or to remove any extensions.
