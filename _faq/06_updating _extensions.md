Updating the extensions automatically does not work as it requires a connection to Google's Chrome web store.   
This is also the reason why the extensions panel at ```chrome://extensions/``` does not work.   
Update any extensions manually by downloading and installing the latest version. Click on the extension icon next to the address bar to access options or to remove extensions.
