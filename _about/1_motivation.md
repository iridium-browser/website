#### Motivation #
There are many browsers out there. Chrome is fast, stable, and user-friendly but does not meet many organizations' demands for privacy. Since the tight integration with its inventor (Google) makes many things easier, it does not comply to restrictive data environments. Iridium is not another new browser from scratch. It takes the Chromium code base, which is also used for the official Chrome browser, and enhances its security and sets certain policies by default. There are many forks of Chromium-based browsers, yet, in our opinion, they failed in many other key areas important for adoption.
