As you can imagine, developing, provisioning of infrastructure, and testing is very intense work. This results in costs to maintain easy imaginable things such as bandwidth, but also infrastructure such as maintaining build systems. For ongoing success and providing builds for multiple platforms, it is key to have dedicated developers focused on this browser project.
