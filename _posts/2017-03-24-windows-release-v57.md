We are happy and a little proud to announce the release of version 57.0 for Windows.     
This release is also available as a Portable version.    

To follow will be releases for the following platforms; **Mac OS X, Ubuntu / Debian, openSUSE** and for the first time **Fedora**

The latest version of the Chromium code base uses way less resources than before and also includes all the latest security features against CVE's.
