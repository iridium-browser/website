As some of you have already noticed with the lastest release, we have changed the version numbers and future builds will have the format **YYYY.MM**, e.g. **2017.10**.      
<!--break-->       
Latest builds are available for **Windows, macOS, openSUSE, Fedora, RHEL/CentOS**.     

Stay tuned for the **Ubuntu/Debain** release.
