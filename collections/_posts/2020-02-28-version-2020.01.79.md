Our Debian/Ubuntu developer has moved on and we are currently looking to fill that position. If you would like to join the development team, 
check out the [source code](https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser "source code") and if you feel comfortable building Iridium 
for Debian-based systems, let us know.
