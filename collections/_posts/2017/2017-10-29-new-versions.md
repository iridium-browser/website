As some of you have already noticed with the lastest release, we have changed the version numbers and future builds will have the format **YYYY.MM**, e.g. **2017.10**.      

Latest builds are available for **Windows, macOS, openSUSE, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux & CentOS**.     

Stay tuned for the **Debian-based systems** release.
