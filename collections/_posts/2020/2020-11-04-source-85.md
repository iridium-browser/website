Iridium version 2020.11.85.0 has been <a href="/downloads/source">made available</a> in source form.

Gaia (Sign In) has been removed from the menu (since it is non-usable and outside the context of Iridium anyhow), and one remaining tenacious Gaia transmission on startup has been terminated too. The new tab page (NTP) is now about:blank, removing the unwarranted retrival of images and favicons from Google and other external websites; Google searches can still be issued from the address bar itself.
