Following the release of **version 2017.11** for **openSUSE** last Friday, the Iridium development team releases the latest version for **Windows**!    
The developer also managed to solve the issue with setting Iridium as the default browser - see [github issue #177](https://github.com/iridium-browser/tracker/issues/177 "see github issue #177")

The latest version 2017.11, is based on Chromium 62.0.3202.94.     
     
New builds for macOS, Debian based systems, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS will all be released this week!
