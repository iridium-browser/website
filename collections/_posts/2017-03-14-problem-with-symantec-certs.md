Finally, we are happy to announce that the latest **Windows** and **Debian-based systems** builds solve the issue with the Symantec certificates failing to load. 
(see bug tracker @ GitHub [issue #124](https://github.com/iridium-browser/tracker/issues/124 "issue #124 @ GitHub"))    

The trouble with SSL certificate handling was quite a challenge. There was no security / privacy problem for the user, but the usability with many sites was poor. 
This is solved now!     

get the fixed version
