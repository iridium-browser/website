Dear All,    
welcome to a fully upgraded new website!    
There will be further updates in the months to come.

Furthermore we are happy to finally release **Version 2020.01.79** for **all platforms**, except Debian-based systems.

Our Debian/Ubuntu developer has moved on and we are currently looking to fill that position. If you would like to join the development team, 
check out the [source code](https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser "source code") and if you feel comfortable building Iridium 
for Debian-based systems, let us know.
