We have now also fixed the bug in the macOS build that was discovered in the latest version.   
The bug prevents downloading extensions, language packs as well as other features that require a third-party connection.   
Privacy and security was never breached at any time!

This has been fixed now and a new macOS version 2020.04 is available for download.
