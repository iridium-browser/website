Iridium Browser is an independent project, not connected to, supported or financed by any search engine.   
The decision for Qwant as default search engine was made in 2015/03, when we were looking for a European search 
engine taking care of privacy and delivering good search results presented in a modern interface. 
At the time, Qwant (*[see Qwant's privacy policy](https://about.qwant.com/legal/privacy/ "see Qwant's privacy policy")*) 
and DuckDuckGo (*[see DuckDuckGo's privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy "see DuckDuckGo's privacy policy")*) 
were on our radar, but Qwant simply impressed us more.     
However, you are free to use any search engine with Iridium Browser.
