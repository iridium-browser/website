Certain extensions do not work due to Iridium Browser's privacy and security settings. Furthermore, some extensions 
are unable to verify Iridium Browser for the same reason.   
If installing via the Chrome Web Store does not work, please downlaod the *.crx file and try to install manually.   
Iridium Browser does not test any extensions and therefore does not block or allow certain extensions by default 
other than by its privacy and security standards.
