Iridium Browser does not download and install updates automatically. Updates can only be applied manually by downloading and installing the latest build. This will not affect saved bookmarks.   
Use ```chrome://help``` to check your build version. Latest versions can always be found in the [download section](/downloads/ "download Iridium Browser / check for updates").   
It is recommended to add the [RSS feed](https://iridiumbrowser.de/feed.xml "add RSS feed"){:target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} or sign up to the [mailing list](http://lists.inai.de/mailman/listinfo/iridium "sign up to our mailing list"){:target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in order to get information about the latest releases.
