Updating the extensions automatically does not work, as it would require a connection to the Chrome Web Store. 
This is also the reason why the extensions panel at ```chrome://extensions``` does not fully work — disabling/enabling (check box) and removing (trash can) will not work. 
Also, all extensions will show a "Not from Chrome Web Store" note, even if downloaded from there.   
Update any extensions manually by downloading and installing the latest version. Click on the extension icon next to the address bar to access options or to remove any extension.     
You may want to backup your extensions settings before updating and reinsert these once updates have been installed. 
The settings can be found in Windows at   
```C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Local\Iridium\User Data\Default\Local Extension Settings```.
