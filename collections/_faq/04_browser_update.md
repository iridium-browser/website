Iridium Browser does not download and install updates automatically as it would need to call home which is blocked 
for maximum privacy.   
Therefore updates can only be applied manually by downloading and installing the latest build. This will not affect 
settings or saved bookmarks.   
Use ```chrome://version``` to check your build version. Latest build versions can always be found in the 
[download](/downloads/ "download Iridium Browser / check for latest version") section.   
It is recommended to add the [RSS feed](https://iridiumbrowser.de/feed.xml "add RSS feed") in order to get 
information about the latest releases.
