_**standard version**_   
Simply download the installer and execute.   

_**portable version**_   
Download the zip-file, save to your desired location and unpack. 
Then execute "iridium.exe", ignore the Defender SmartScreen warning by clicking on "additional information" and 
click "execute anyway".   
Please note:   
Running the Iridium Browser portable version works out of the box. 
We recommend to create a shortcut using the   
```--user-data-dir=/IridiumUserData```    
configuration option to store the user data to a preferred location (like a USB stick, etc.)
